Slim case for the Lilka education/gaming console by Anderson & co (https://lilka.dev/shop/).

This case measures 24x58x149mm and uses the full set of hardware from IMRAD.COM.UA with no additional parts required. It is made with a slim battery (PR-285083) in mind.

**Building instructions:**
Be prepared for lots of filing, and soldering to brass standoffs.

**Updates:**
1. An upper shell with an asymmetrical (1mm to the right) display cutout was added.
2. A blank lower plate with bolt cap indents was added.

Your comments, makes, and most importantly, donations to support Ukraine (https://u24.gov.ua/) are much appreciated.
